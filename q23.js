//Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:
//let car = 'subaru';
//console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
//console.log(car == 'subaru')
//â€¢ closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
var car = "subaru";
console.log("is car == 'subaru'? predict true");
console.log(car == 'subaru');
console.log("is car != 'honda city ? predict true");
